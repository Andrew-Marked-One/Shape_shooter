### Project #2
Timeline: 2023.12.3 - 2024.1.11

This is my first SFML and C++ project. I started a game programming course but struggled with C++ and SFML when it was time to create the first game. So, I paused the course to learn C++ better.
After a month of studying, I learned a ton of basic concepts and gained confidence in my abilities, which allowed me to finish this project in a week.
